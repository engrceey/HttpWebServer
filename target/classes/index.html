<header><h1>Here are some facts about Java which you probably did not know:</h1></header>

<main>
    <ol>
        <li><h3>Java was called Oak at the beginning</h3></li>
        <p class="justify">The original name for Java was Oak. It was eventually changed to Java by Sun's marketing department when Sun lawyers found that there
            was already a computer company registered as Oak. But a legend has it that Gosling and his gang of programmers went out to the local cafe
            to discuss names and ended up naming it Java. There seems to be some
            truth in this as the "0xCafeBabe" magic number in the class files was named after the Cafe where the Java team used to go for coffee.
        </p>

        <li><h3>It was just an accident!</h3></li>
        <p class="justify">James Gosling was working at Sun Labs, around 1992. Gosling and his team was building a set-top box and started by
            "cleaning up" C++ and wound up with a new language and runtime. Thus, Java or Oak came into being.
        </p>

        <li><h3>You are paid to learn Java</h3></li>
        <p class="justify">The median salary of a Java developer is USD 83,975. Yes, it pays to be a Java developer and
            programmers are milking it. There are about 9 million Java developers in the world.
        </p>

        <li><h3>Second most popular language</h3></li>
        <p class="justify">Though many would argue that Java is all time favourite among developers, it is the second most popular
            programming language after C. Java is ranked second in popularity among programming languages.
        </p>

        <li><h3>The Duke</h3></li>
        <p class="justify">The Java mascot, 'The Duke' was created by Joe Palrang. Palrang is the same guy who has worked on the Hollywood
            blockbuster, Shrek. Duke is celebrated at Oracle. A living, life-size Duke
            is a popular feature at every JavaOne developer conference. Each year, Oracle releases a new Duke personality.
        </p>

        <li><h3>Most popular user interface</h3></li>
        <p class="justify">Currently, about 3 billion mobile phones are working in Java, as well as 125 million TV sets and each Blu-Ray player. This language is
            continually ranked first in the rankings of software developers as the best choice of programming languages.
        </p>

        <li><h3>Final is not final in Java</h3></li>
        <p class="justify">
            Final actually has four different meanings in Java.
            final class: the class cannot be extended
            final method: the method cannot be overridden
            final field: the field is a constant
            final variable: the value of the variable cannot be changed once assigned.
